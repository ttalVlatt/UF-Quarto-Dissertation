$\bigcap$ & A really big bigcap\\
\\
fractal & A geometric pattern that is repeated at ever smaller
scales to produce irregular shapes and surfaces that cannot be represented by classical
geometry. Fractals are used especially in computer modeling of irregular patterns and structures in nature.\\
\\
polynomial & (in one variable) an expression consisting of the sum of two
or more terms each of which is the product of a constant and a
variable raised to an integral power: $ax^2 + bx + c$ is a
polynomial, where $a, b,$ and $c$ are constants and $x$ is a
variable.\\
