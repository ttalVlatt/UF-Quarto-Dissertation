\usepackage{pgfplots}%   pgfplots is tikz but better.
%\usepackage{amsrefs}%   amsrefs contains the .bibtex style content for mathematician papers.

%% Uncomment the relevant line below if you have tables or figures.
\haveTablestrue%        Uncomment this if you have tables in your thesis.
\haveFigurestrue%       Uncomment this if you have figures in your thesis.
%\haveObjectstrue%       Uncomment this if you have Objects in your thesis. This is almost certainly not the case however.

%%% Below are the commands to set the degree type, department, graduation time, and chair. 
%       Most of these are self explanatory. 
%       Note: The \chair command takes an optional argument for a cochair. 
%           So if John was your chair and Jacob was a cochair, you would use \chair[Jacob]{John}.
%           If John was your chair and you had no cochair, you can simply use \chair{John}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\title{$title$}%  Put your title here.

\degreeType{$degree$}%   Official name of your degree; eg "Doctor of Philosophy".
\major{$major$}%                    Your official Department
\author{$author$}%                  Your Name
\thesisType{$doc-type$}%              Dissertation (PhD) or Thesis (Masters)
\degreeYear{$year$}%                      Intended graduation year (not the year you submit the thesis)
\degreeMonth{$month$}%                   Month of graduation should be May, August, or December.
\chair[$co-chair$]{$chair$}%                   Chair and Cochair (see comment block above).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% For each of the following, type in the name of the file that contains each section. 
% They are assumed to be tex files, but if they aren't the command takes an optional argument for the extension.
%So, you could load dedication.tex as your dedication file using \setDedicationFile{dedication}
% You could load dedication.txt instead with \setDedicationFile[txt]{dedication}.

% NOTE: For some compilers they may or may not add a .tex to the end of the file automatically.
% If you get a "couldn't find dedication.tex.tex" type error, try the command with an empty optional argument,
%e.g. \setDedicationFile[]{dedication}
%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%% These are REQUIRED sections; easiest to do via these commands.

\setDedicationFile{preface/dedicationFile}%                 Dedication Page
\setAcknowledgementsFile{preface/acknowledgmentsFile}%     Acknowledgements Page
\setAbstractFile{preface/abstractFile}%                     Abstract Page (This should only include the abstract itself)
%\setReferenceFile{referenceFile}{amsplain}%         References. First argument is your bibtex source file
%                                                       the second argument is your bibtex style file.

\setBiographicalFile{preface/biographyFile}%                Biography file of the Author (you).

%%% These are NOT required, so only use them if you actually need/have them.

\setAbbreviationsFile{preface/abbreviationsFile}%           Abbreviations Page
%\setAppendixFile{appendix}%                     Appendix Content; hyperlinking might be weird.
%\multipleAppendixtrue%                          Uncomment this if you have more than one appendix, 
%                                                   comment it if you have only one appendix.

%%%% Here you just need to include/input your actual work. 
%       The above files (dedication, acknowledgement, titlepage, etc etc) will all be added for you 
%       using the files you assigned above. 
%       If you want to input the above files manually you can comment out the \setFILE command above

%       NOTE: If you input manually you will have to do some/all the formatting manually.
