Figures can be included one of two ways.

# As Quarto Output

For simpler plots where the default output and scaling works, you can include them from an R (or Python etc.) code block 

```{r}
#| label: fig-gators
#| fig-cap: Albert and Alberta's Times
#| fig-pos: H
#| echo: fenced

data <- tribble(~date, ~mascot, ~time,
                2020, "Albert", 300,
                2020, "Alberta", 290,
                2021, "Albert", 280,
                2021, "Alberta", 285,
                2022, "Albert", 278,
                2022, "Alberta", 275,
                2023, "Albert", 285,
                2023, "Alberta", 275,
                2024, "Albert", 270,
                2024, "Alberta", 265,
                2025, "Albert", 265,
                2025, "Alberta", 260)

ggplot(data) +
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = time, color = mascot)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#FA4616", "#0021A5"))


```

```{r}
ggsave("figures/gator-plot.png")
```


For these you need to use [Quarto's figure cross referencing](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#cross-references).
This means labeling the chunk starting with fig `#| label: fig-gators` and adding a caption `#| fig-cap: Albert and Alberta's Times`.

You can then refer to this plot with `@fig-gators` in your markdown text and it will create in text figure numbers correctly based on chapter and order and hyperlink directly to the figure.

# As an Image

Sometimes you might have figures created elsewhere, or, want to have more control over the scaling/shape of the plot than you get with Quarto by default.
In this case, you want to save the figures as an image (e.g., my-plot.png) and the add and cross reference it using inline markdown like `![Albert and Alberta's Times](figures/gator-plot.png){#fig-gators}`.
This was how I handled most of my plots.

![Albert and Alberta's Times](figures/gator-plot.png){#fig-gators-inline}

# Mix n' Match

Finally, you can mix and match these methods and all the figure numbering keeps up to date, no extra steps needed!

# Location of Figures

One thing to note is where you are placing figures.
I woukd advise not worrying about this until you have a solid draft of your content.
If placed in the middle of the chapter, you cannot have any blank lines before of after the plot.
So, you ussually want to identify the first paragraph on a page, and place the plot code (with `#| fig-pos: H` as in the example) right after that paragraph.
LaTeX will sometimes be stubborn about figure placement, but if you follow the above advice, it should work for smaller figures.
Otherwise, you can place any figures at the end of each chapter.
All numbering and cross references will work no matter which option you choose.
